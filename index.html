			<p>Tigers are most recognizable for their dark vertical stripes on orangish fur, with most likely a white underside. With it being classified in the genus Panthera, you can see the resemblance in structure with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard who also make up the Panthera genus. Tigers primarily prey on animals such as deer as well as bovids. Tigers are very territorial and are generally solitary but social animals. This often results in large habitats in order to support their prey requirements. Because the tiger is indigenous to heavily populated areas as well as the need for a large habitat, conflicts with humans has become significant.  </p>

        <p>Of the original nine subspecies of tigers, three have become extinct in the last 80 years; an average of one every 20 years. Some scientists have predicted that tigers may become extinct in the wild within the next decade. This is a result of poaching, habitat loss as well as fragmentation leading to the decline of more than 96,000 tigers from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Today, while two of the subspecies are critically endangered, four out of the remaining six are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The total makeup of the tiger population of all six of the remaining subspecies is estimated to be between 3,000 to 3,600 tigers. </p>
